We're going to look at how we might read, interpret and refactor somebody else's code.

Taking a sample solution to [Codecademy's Game of Chance project](https://www.codecademy.com/practice/projects/games-of-chance) as a starting point, we'll look at how we can improve the solution.

## Learning Outcomes

- Read and interpret somebody else's code
- Extract out reusable helper functions
- Articulate the DRY principle

## Exercise 1: Installing and running

**Success criterion:** you can view evidence your server is running at `localhost:4000`

Firstly, clone this repository to your local machine in some sensible place, for example:

```bash
cd ~/Development/Academy/Mark/fundamentals # or wherever you're organising everything
git clone https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/my-little-server.git my-little-server
```

Then, change into the new directory and install the files:

```bash
cd my-little-server
yarn
```

Finally, run your first Express server!

```bash
yarn start
```

The `start` script is configured such that the Express server will run by default on your local machine at `localhost:4000`.

You will need to manually confirm this through visiting `localhost:4000` in your browser. You can also visit some different endpoints which are defined, e.g. `localhost:4000/current-time`.

## Exercise 2: Reading, understanding and documenting

**Success criterion:** a document which outlines how you think this Express server works. You don't have to achieve a theory which explains 100%, but you should strive to explain as much as possible.

(N.B.: The _correctness_ of your theory is **much less important** than the _process_ of forming this document. [Forming a prediction, and then discovering it was wrong, is an effective way to learn](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959475217303468)!)

1. Take some time to read and digest the code
2. Google things that you don't understand
3. Experiment with changing things
4. Produce a narrative document

A good narrative document for this game would explain what code gets executed when the server is started, and what code gets executed when different endpoints are hit - and how what you see in your browser (as the server response) either changes / does not change on subsequent requests depending on the route.

(Some routes will give you back the same response each time, and others won't. Why is that?)

## Exercise 3: Writing your own Express route

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** you can visit `localhost:5050/hello-world`, `localhost:5050/ponies/random` and `localhost:5050/history` in the browser, with the expected behaviour (detailed below).

Now that you've been

### `/hello-world`

### `/ponies/random`

### `/history`

Can you populate it with some information about yourself (a short bio, maybe a CV-esque thing) and render the component through your React app?

(It's up to you as to whether you replace other bits of HTML or the other component, `MyFirstReactComponent`; all that's required is that you can see your component's rendered HTML. Don't forget that you'll need to refresh when you make changes!)

## Exercise 4: Check your understanding

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** a conversation with a Faculty member and amended comments.

Talk to a member of Faculty about your understanding of the game and of TypeScript.

Amend your notes for any important points that come out of the conversation.

## Exercise 5: Commentary and reflection

**Success criterion:** documented reflections.
